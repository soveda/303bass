# Fr330hfr33 Experimental Web MIDI Protocol

This records the SysEx protocol shared by the firmware and Web MIDI editor.

## Message layout

All values are MIDI-safe 7-bit bytes.

```text
F0 7D 46 33 30 33 01
   scale
   accent_probability
   octave_span
   tempo_lsb
   tempo_msb
   root_note
   gate_length
   glide_probability
   midi_channel
   midi_clock_sync
   base_midi_note
   waveform
   distortion_mode
   distortion_amount
   distortion_tone
   filter_poles
   acidness
F7
```

The complete message is 25 bytes including `F0` and `F7`. The firmware stores
the 23 bytes between them in `sysex[]`.

## Header

| Wire bytes | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `F0` | SysEx start |
| 1 | `7D` | Educational/non-commercial manufacturer ID |
| 2–5 | `46 33 30 33` | ASCII `F303` |
| 6 | `01` | Configuration command |

## Configuration fields

The SysEx offsets match the firmware's internal `sysex[]` array. Wire offsets
include the leading `F0`.

| SysEx offset | Wire offset | Field | Values |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 6 | 7 | Scale | `0` major pentatonic, `1` minor pentatonic, `2` Ionian, `3` Lydian, `4` melodic minor, `5` chromatic |
| 7 | 8 | Accent probability | `0–100` percent |
| 8 | 9 | Sequencer octave span | `1–4` |
| 9 | 10 | Tempo low 7 bits | Combined with the next byte |
| 10 | 11 | Tempo high 7 bits | Result clamped to `30–240` BPM |
| 11 | 12 | Root note | `0–11`, C through B |
| 12 | 13 | Gate length | `10–95` percent |
| 13 | 14 | Sequencer legato probability | `0–100` percent; selected transitions keep the gate high and become slides or repeated-note ties |
| 14 | 15 | MIDI input channel | `0–15`, representing channels 1–16 |
| 15 | 16 | MIDI clock sync | Bit 0: `0` disabled, `1` enabled |
| 16 | 17 | Base MIDI note | `24`, `36`, `48`, or `60` |
| 17 | 18 | Waveform | `0` saw, `1` square |
| 18 | 19 | Distortion mode | `0` off, `1` RAT-style, `2` Tube Screamer-style |
| 19 | 20 | Distortion amount | `0–100`; zero bypasses distortion and tone |
| 20 | 21 | Distortion tone | `0–100`, dark to bright |
| 21 | 22 | Diode filter poles | `4` for 24 dB/octave, `3` for 18 dB/octave |
| 22 | 23 | Acidness | `0–100`; coordinated generator and pattern-mutation intensity |

Wire byte 24 is `F7`, the SysEx terminator.

## Distortion behavior

Distortion applies only to Audio Out 1's filtered voice. Audio Out 2 remains
the phase-aligned raw selected oscillator.

- RAT-style mode uses variable pre-gain, symmetrical hard clipping, and a
  post-clip low-pass tone control.
- Tube Screamer-style mode uses variable pre-gain, a soft clipping knee, fixed
  mid emphasis, and variable treble presence.
- Amount zero bypasses clipping and distortion tone processing.

These are lightweight character approximations, not circuit-level pedal
models.

## Backward compatibility

The firmware accepts these internal SysEx lengths:

| Length | Last field present |
| ---: | --- |
| 17 | Base MIDI note; release-candidate editor |
| 19 | Distortion mode |
| 20 | Distortion amount |
| 21 | Distortion tone |
| 22 | Diode filter pole count |
| 23 | Acidness |

Missing optional fields retain their current/default values:

- Waveform: saw
- Distortion: off
- Amount: 50%
- Tone: 50%
- Diode filter: four pole / 24 dB per octave

Invalid values are clamped or replaced with safe defaults.

## Maintenance notes

Command `01` retains its original configuration prefix. If a future
change alters existing field meanings or ordering, use a new command byte
rather than reinterpreting command `01`.

## Command 02 — editable pattern

The separate-lane pattern is sent as a second message:

```text
F0 7D 46 33 30 33 02
   enabled
   pattern_length
   [note octave accent gate tie] × 16
   initial_step
   reverse
   pendulum
   active_slot
F7
```

There are 92 bytes between `F0` and `F7`, and 94 bytes on the wire. Firmware
also accepts the earlier 88–91 byte payloads; missing fields default to
Initial Step 1, forward playback, pendulum off, and slot 1.

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled | `0` keeps the generative sequencer; `1` uses the editable pattern |
| Pattern length | `1–16` steps |
| Note | `0–11`, chromatic C through B; Root transposes it |
| Octave | `0–3`, added above Base Octave |
| Accent | `0` normal, `1` accented |
| Gate | `10–95` percent of that step |
| Tie | `1` holds this step’s gate into the following step |
| Initial step | Stored as `0–15`, displayed as steps `1–16`; selects the first lane column read |
| Reverse | `0` forward, `1` reverse |
| Pendulum | `0` loop, `1` bounce between both ends without repeating the turnaround step |
| Active slot | `0–3`, representing slots 1–4 |

A tied transition to a different programmed pitch slides without retriggering.
A tied transition to the same pitch is a true repeated-note tie. Ties follow
the selected playback direction. Unsaved edits are session-only; the active
saved slot returns after reset.

## Commands 03 and 04 — pattern slots

```text
F0 7D 46 33 30 33 03 slot F7   recall slot
F0 7D 46 33 30 33 04 slot F7   save current pattern to slot
```

Slot is `0–3`. Recall changes the running pattern immediately. Save copies the
current lane data and playback settings into the selected card-flash slot.
Global command-01 settings are also persistent and restore automatically at
boot.

Flash storage follows Cizzle’s scheme: a versioned structure in the final flash
sector, an FNV-1a checksum, validity checks on boot, and erase/program only when
the complete stored state has changed.

When adding fields:

1. Append them after the current payload.
2. Increase the firmware SysEx buffer if necessary.
3. Accept the previous payload length where practical.
4. Update the editor, firmware parser, and this document together.
